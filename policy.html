                <div class="title">What is a privacy policy?</div>
                <p>A privacy policy is a document that states what personal data you collect from your users, why, and how you keep it private. The purpose of the privacy policy is to inform your users about how their data is being handled. Hence, the privacy policy should be accessible for your users and kept in a plain and readable language.
                </p>
                <p>Most countries have privacy laws requiring that websites collecting personal data have a proper privacy policy in place. Failure to comply can result in heavy fines and even prosecution.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <div class="title">Do I need a privacy policy for my website?</div>

                <p>You probably do. If your website collects personal data, you need a privacy policy. Most websites collect user data. Often, it happens without the website owner even being aware of it, by means of cookies. If your website is hosted, or if you use plugins, social media-buttons, analytics tools and the like on your website, then it does set cookies and collect user data. With the enforcement of the GDPR and the EU ePrivacy regulation, a proper privacy policy is adamant for websites in the EU and websites that have EU-citizens amongst their users. If you are in doubt about the use of cookies on your website, you can try and take an audit of your website here for free.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The free audit scans five pages of your website and sends you a report of the cookies and online tracking on these pages, including information on their provenance, purpose and whether or not they are compliant. If you want a complete overview of the cookies and online tracking going on on all of your website, sign up to the Cookiebot solution.

            <div class="item">
                <div class="title">How can I get a privacy policy on my website?</div>
                <p>The privacy policy can be written as an independent page on your website, and be made accessible as a link in the header or footer of your website, or on your ‘About’ page. It may also be hosted by a privacy policy-service with a link from your homepage. Basically, it doesn’t matter where you choose to place it, as long as your users have access to it.

                </p>
                <p>The privacy policy is a legal text. The phrasing depends on which jurisdictions your website falls under and how your website handles data. All websites are different. We always recommend that you consult a lawyer to ensure that your privacy policy is compliant with all applicable laws. However, this might seem as a large expense if you are, for instance, a hobby blogger or small business.

                    GDPR compliant privacy policy templates, samples & generators There exists numerous tools for creating privacy policies, and privacy policy templates and generators on the internet. Some are free and others come at a price. Check out this useful list of privacy policy generators.

                <div class="title">Privacy policy and cookies</div>
                <p>Cookies usually are the trickiest part of making your website compliant with regulations for privacy and data protection. Most of the other data collection activities going on in connection to your website are both static and visible: The contact form or newsletter-subscription only changes if you actively make changes to it, and the user is aware of giving personal information when they chose to fill them out.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Cookies, on the other hand, operate in the background. They are quietly dropped on the user’s computer without the user (or sometimes even the website owner, for that sake) being aware of what is going on. Once dropped, the cookies can collect a lot of different types of data for any given length of time, and send this data out ‘into the world’.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Moreover, cookies are numerous and dynamic, tending to change often. The General Data Protection Regulation requires that the communication about the use of data is both specific and accurate. This means, in practice, that whereas the remainder of the privacy policy may be a static document, the section on cookies should be updated fairly regularly. This issue can be solved if you choose a cookie solution like Cookiebot for your website.

                </p>
                <p>Cookiebot performs monthly scans of your website, giving a complete overview of the cookies in use. This information is 1) sent to the website owner, 2) presented to the user in a comprehensive consent banner upon their first visit, and, lastly, but most important in the present context, can be integrated as part of your privacy policy with a few lines of Javascript. This way, you can make sure that your information on cookies is continually up to date.</p>
